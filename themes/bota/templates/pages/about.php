                <h2 class="section-title">Why Boterns Exists</h2>
                <div class="story-content">
                    <p>Most SEO agencies treat SaaS companies like any other client. They pitch the same "increase your rankings" playbook they use for local restaurants and e-commerce stores. They hand you off to junior teams after the sales call. They report on metrics that don't move your business forward.</p>

                    <p>If you're a SaaS founder or marketing leader, you don't care about ranking #1 for some random keyword. You care about whether organic search is driving qualified trial signups, reducing your CAC, and building a sustainable acquisition channel that doesn't disappear the moment you pause your ad spend.</p>

                    <p>That's why we started Boterns—to build an agency that actually understands SaaS business models, speaks the language of MRR and LTV, and delivers strategies that impact the metrics your investors care about.</p>

                    <p>We intentionally stay small. We work with a limited number of clients at a time because we've seen what happens when agencies scale too fast—quality tanks, junior teams take over, and clients become account numbers instead of partnerships.</p>

                    <p>Every company we work with gets direct access to senior strategists who've driven real results for SaaS businesses. No bait-and-switch. No handoffs. Just the expertise you're actually paying for.</p>

                <div class="difference-card">
                    <h3 class="difference-title">We Only Work With SaaS</h3>
                    <p class="difference-text">While other agencies juggle e-commerce, local businesses, and everything in between, we focus exclusively on software companies. This means we understand your business model, your customer journey, and the metrics that actually matter to you. We know the difference between vanity traffic and revenue-driving searches.</p>

                <div class="difference-card">
                    <h3 class="difference-title">No Junior Teams, Ever</h3>
                    <p class="difference-text">The person you meet on your kickoff call? That's who's building your strategy, analyzing your competitors, and creating your content roadmap. We don't have layers of account managers and junior specialists. You work directly with the people who know what they're doing.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="difference-card">
                    <h3 class="difference-title">Limited Client Roster</h3>
                    <p class="difference-text">We cap our active projects at 8 clients. This isn't a constraint—it's a feature. Your business gets the attention it deserves. You're not competing with 50 other accounts for your strategist's time. When you email, you get a response. When you need something, it gets done.</p>

                <div class="difference-card">
                    <h3 class="difference-title">Revenue-Focused Strategies</h3>
                    <p class="difference-text">We don't report on rankings for the sake of rankings. Every strategy we build is tied to your business goals: increasing trial signups, driving demo bookings, lowering CAC, or boosting MRR. If it doesn't impact revenue, we're not wasting your time on it.</p>

                <div class="difference-card">
                    <h3 class="difference-title">Transparent Reporting</h3>
                    <p class="difference-text">You'll get monthly reports showing exactly how organic traffic is impacting your key metrics. We track trial signups from organic, conversion rates by content piece, and ROI on every dollar spent. No hiding behind vanity metrics or industry jargon.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="difference-card">
                    <h3 class="difference-title">We Actually Respond</h3>
                    <p class="difference-text">Ever work with an agency where your emails go into a black hole? Not here. Because we limit our client load and you work directly with senior people, you get real responsiveness. Questions get answered. Concerns get addressed. You're not shouting into the void.</p>
